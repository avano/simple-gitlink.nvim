# simple-gitlink.nvim
A simple link to the Git UI from nvim

## Motivation
In my workflow, I primarily use `origin` and `upstream` remotes in Git, where `origin` points to my fork and `upstream` to the upstream repository. Sometimes, I want to quickly generate a link to the Git web UI without manually specifying a remote.

Most other plugins either default to the first remote they find, require you to manually specify a remote every time, or fail with an error if the branch doesnâ€™t exist on the remote. This can be inconvenient when you have local work in progress but want to link to code that already exists on the remote.
This plugin provides a more efficient solution: you supply a list of remotes, and the plugin will automatically choose the first remote that contains a branch matching the name of your current branch. 
If no such remote exists, the default remote (as defined by `git config --get checkout.defaultremote`) is selected, and its default branch is used to generate the Git link.

## Usage

To use this plugin with the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager, add the following configuration to your `lazy.nvim` setup:

```lua
return {
  'avano/simple-gitlink.nvim',
  event = 'VeryLazy',
  config = function()
    require('gitlink').setup({
      remotes = 'origin,upstream'
    })
    -- map the key binding in normal and visual mode
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x'}, '<leader>gl', require('gitlink').create_git_link, { desc = 'Git: Link' })
  end
}
```
